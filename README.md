contains homework for week 11



This Contains the K-clustering homework

For this homework, I've used code from my own respositories as well as:
https://realpython.com/k-means-clustering-python/
https://cmdlinetips.com/2019/05/k-means-clustering-in-python/

To run the code, simply use python3 Clustering.py

you can also change the blob data parameter's using -samp, -cstd, and -cents, which change sample size, cluster standard deviation, and number of clusters respectively.
